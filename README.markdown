# FirePython

FirePython is a sexy Python logger console integrated into [Firebug 1.3][firebug]. 

<font size="2">Originally, I have created it to light up my lonely nights I was spending with [Google App Engine][appengine].</font>

## Prerequisites

You definitely need [Firebug 1.3][firebug].

## Installation

### Firefox Addon
Preferred way is to install this firefox extension via addons.mozilla.com.
The latest version is [available here][firepython].

<font size="2" color="grey">Warning: some people have reported they are unable to download and install extension from addons.mozilla.com. 
In this case you may [try workaround][workaround].</font>

### Python Library

#### The easy way:

``sudo easy_install firepython``

#### The manual way:

Clone [project from github][homepage] and copy folder [python/firepython][firepython-folder] in your project directory.
Or alternatively you may want to add folder [python][python-folder] into your ``sys.path``.

It depends on simplejson!

## Usage:

### Django

After installation, enable middleware by adding its path in ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``: ``firepython.middleware.FirePythonDjango``. 

### WSGI compatible

After installation, enable middleware ``firepython.middleware.FirePythonWSGI``.

### Custom usage

In all places where you want to capture logging ...

<code>

    import firepython

    # somewhere at the beginning of your response, before any of your loggings take place:
    handler = firepython.FirePythonLogHandler()
    logger = logging.getLogger()
    logger.addHandler(handler)
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
  
    # ... your handler code here

    # right before serving your response back to client:
    logger.removeHandler(handler)
    handler.flush(response.add_header)   # this will add headers into response
</code>



# Current State

Version 0.1 is tested to work with alpha Firebug 1.3 and Firefox 3.1.
