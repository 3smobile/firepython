Testing
~~~~~~~

Be sure to install Paver before doing any development or testing.::

    easy_install Paver

    # or:

    pip install Paver


Also, make sure that ``FirePython`` is either "developed" or installed.::

    paver develop

    # or:

    paver install


Running tests with Paver
++++++++++++++++++++++++

While invoking ``nosetests`` from the project base directory will
run the unit tests, you'll probably want to run all integration tests
as well.  The ``pavement.py`` file includes a ``testall`` task for
doing exactly that.::

    paver testall


Optional dependencies
+++++++++++++++++++++

The ``FirePython`` WSGI middleware may be used with ``Paste``.  If you
have ``Paste`` and ``PasteDeploy`` installed, the ``testall`` task
**should** run the paste integration test.

If running tests on Linux, the integration test for the mini graphviz
helper script should run, but will fail if either the ``dot`` or ``eog``
binaries is not present in the ``$PATH``.  Invoking the ``firepython-graphviz``
script with the ``--help`` flag should be "helpful".


Demo Application
++++++++++++++++

Invoking the ``firepython-demo-app`` will start up a server running the demo
application, indicating port number in the stdout.  If the demo application
fails for any reason, it most likely indicates a missing dependency.  Please
be sure to save any Tracebacks for inclusion when reporting issues on github.
