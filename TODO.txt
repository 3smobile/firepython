TODO
====
 - add an entry point for using the middleware with ``Paste``
 - get the dependency stuff sorted out with regard to ``jsonpickle``
   and ``gprof2dot`` so that the embedding/patching step is unnecessary
 - break dependency on filesystem layout with regard to ``firelogger``
 - build and distribute docs with Sphinx
