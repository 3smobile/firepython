TODO
====
 - convert from ``setuptools`` to ``Paver``, port all ``rakefile``` tasks to ``pavement`` tasks
 - get the dependency stuff sorted out with regard to ``jsonpickle``
   so that the embedding step is unnecessary
 - add an entry point for using the middleware with ``Paste``
 - break dependency on filesystem layout with regard to ``firelogger``,
   possible when converting from ``rake`` to ``Paver``
 - build and distribute docs with Sphinx
